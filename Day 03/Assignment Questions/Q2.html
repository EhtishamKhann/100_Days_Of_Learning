    <!-- Qs2. Is video tag a semantic tag? -->

    <!-- Yes, the video tag is considered a semantic tag in HTML5 because it clearly describes the content it contains (a video) to both browsers and developers, unlike non-semantic tags like <div> or <span> which only describe presentation, helping with accessibility and SEO.  -->
