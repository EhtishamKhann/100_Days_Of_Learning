// Q1. Find the errors in the following code

// a

// let 1age = 5;
// let 2age = 10 ;

// variable name cannot be started from numbers in JavaScript

// b

let marks = 75;
let isPass = True;

// the True must be written "true" in small alphabits 

// c

isPass = 'true';

// there is not an error in the line but if the isPass is a boolean variable then it is not storing a boolean value it is storing a sting
